                    Palestinian city of Al-Quds, considered one of the holiest and oldest cities in the world.
                    The city of Al-Quds is distinguished as the place associated with the most prominent religious events and figures in
                    the world. It is home to three of the most important sacred sites in the major monotheistic religions: <br>
                    - Al-Aqsa mosques
                    - The Church of the Holy Sepulchre <br>
                    - The Western Wall (also known as the Wailing Wall)

                <p><span class="name-city">Gaza</span>
                    
                    Gaza's roots dig deep into antiquity, with evidence of settlement dating back to the Bronze Age. Throughout the ages, it
                    has been a strategic trading post, connecting continents and cultures. Pharaohs, Persians, Greeks, Romans, and Crusaders
                    have all left their mark on its storied streets. <br>
                    
                    <b>The Modern Epoch:</b> <br>
                    In the 20th century, Gaza witnessed seismic shifts. From Ottoman rule to British mandate, and eventually, the Israeli
                    occupation following the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, Gaza became a focal point of regional conflict. The 1967 Six-Day War
                    brought Gaza under Israeli control, marking the beginning of a protracted struggle for self-determination. <br>
                    
                    <a href="https://studies.aljazeera.net/en/node/5322" target="_blank">A Symbol of Struggle:</a> <br>
                    Gaza City became synonymous with resistance and resilience. Waves of Palestinian refugees, displaced from their homes
                    during the creation of Israel, found sanctuary within its borders. Decades of occupation, conflict, and blockade have
                    taken their toll on Gaza's infrastructure and economy, yet its people endure, steadfast in their pursuit of justice and
                    freedom. <br>
                    
                    <b>The Siege and Its Toll:</b><br>
                    In recent years, Gaza has been besieged by a blockade, severely restricting the flow of goods and people in and out of
                    the territory. This blockade, coupled with periodic military incursions and conflicts, has led to dire humanitarian
                    conditions, with shortages of essential resources like water, electricity, and medical supplies. <br>
                    
                    <b>The Spirit of Resilience:</b> <br>
                    Despite the challenges, Gaza City pulsates with life. Its bustling markets, vibrant culture, and indomitable spirit defy
                    the odds. From fishermen braving the blockade to artisans preserving traditional crafts, Gaza's resilience is a
                    testament to the human spirit's capacity to endure and thrive amidst adversity. <br>
                    
                    <b>A Call for Hope:</b> <br>
                    As the world bears witness to Gaza's plight, calls for justice and peace reverberate across the globe. The people of
                    Gaza yearn for a future free from occupation and blockade, where they can rebuild their lives and realize their
                    aspirations for prosperity and dignity. <br>
                    
                    <b>In Conclusion:</b>
                    Gaza City stands as a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of adversity. Its history, marked by struggle
                    and resilience, serves as a reminder of the urgent need for a just and lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian
                    conflict—one that respects the rights and dignity of all people involved. <br>
                    
                    As Gaza City continues to navigate the complexities of its past and present, one thing remains clear: its people are
                    determined to shape their own destiny and reclaim their place in the tapestry of human history. <br>

                <p> <span class="name-city">Haifa</span> Haifa is an ancient Canaanite prehistoric city built on Mount Carmel.
                Haifa is located on the Mediterranean coast in northern Palestine at the confluence of latitude 32.49 north and
                longitude 35 east. It is the meeting point of the Mediterranean Sea with both the plain and Mount Carmel. This makes it
                an obligatory crossing point, as the width of the coastal plain is less than 200 metres.
                Its strategic location made it a seaport that became the first in Palestine. It also made it a gateway to Iraq, Jordan,
                and South Syria across the Mediterranean.
                It was of commercial and military importance throughout its history, which is why it was exposed to colonial ambitions,
                starting from the Crusader invasion until the Zionist occupation.
                Railway lines extended to it to connect it with Palestinian and Arab cities, from Gaza and Lod to Beirut, Tripoli and
                Damascus.
                As for its name, some believe that it came from the word Hafa, meaning beach, and it may be taken from Al-Haifa, meaning
                a side. Others believe that the origin of Al-Haifa is an umbrella or a reserve, because Mount Carmel surrounds it,
                protects it, and shades it.
                It was mentioned in ancient books as Skymenos, and the Crusaders called it Kifa and sometimes Sykamenion, which in Greek
                means mulberry tree. This may be due to the large number of mulberry trees in Haifa.
                Haifa was conquered during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan, by Amr bin Al-Aas in 633 AD. As a
                result, Arab tribes began to settle in Palestine, especially in the areas of the Palestinian coast, and Haifa remained
                part of the Islamic state throughout the Umayyad and Abbasid eras.
                Foreign settlement in the city began in 1868 by a group of German families coming from southwestern Germany. They
                established a settlement in the western part of the city and followed the construction of German settlements in the
                coastal area. These settlements eventually paved the way for the establishment of the first German neighborhood in the
                modern style in The city, which is the "Carmelheim" neighborhood on Mount Carmel <a href="https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2006/7/17/%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%A7"
                    target="_blank">Sources</a>. <br>
                <span style="color: red; margin-top: 2px; font-size: 20px;">It is noteworthy that the city was occupied by Jewish organizations on April 21, 1948, after several battles and
                massacres carried out against the Arab residents of the city and its suburbs, which resulted in the mass expulsion of
                most of these residents from their neighborhoods, and the direct replacement of the names of Arab streets and areas with
                Hebrew After the Jews occupied the city, its Palestinian Arab residents were forced to leave, their homes were confiscated, and
                they were not allowed to return to it. It was occupied by Jewish immigrants, who later increased, and their number has
                now reached about 300,000 people. </span>

                <p > <span class="name-city">Al-Khalil</span> Al-Khalil is a Palestinian city, and the administrative center of Hebron Governorate. It is located in the West Bank, about
                35 km south of Jerusalem. It was founded by the Canaanites in the Early Bronze Age, and today it is considered the
                largest city in the West Bank in terms of population and area, as its population in 2016 reached approximately 215
                thousand people, and its area is 42 km2. The city is distinguished by its economic importance, as it is considered one
                of the largest economic centers in the West Bank. Hebron has religious importance for the three Abrahamic religions, as
                in the center of the city is the Ibrahimi Mosque, which contains the shrines of the prophets Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
                their wives.
                
                The city of Hebron is currently divided into the old and the new city, and is administered by the Hebron Municipality,
                which was established in 1927. It is also the center of the Hebron Governorate, whose current administrative division
                includes dozens of villages and towns, and the governorate’s population is estimated at more than 684 thousand people
                (2014). The old city is located adjacent to the Ibrahimi Mosque. It consists of old alleys, houses, and shops, and
                includes many markets. Israel closes large parts of it and deploys Israeli army forces there due to a recent gathering
                of Orthodox Jews seeking to control real estate in that area. Israel controls about 20% of the city's area according to
                the Hebron redeployment agreement in 1997, but the Palestinian Authority is responsible for managing the civil affairs
                of the Palestinians there. The city is also surrounded by many Israeli settlements, the largest of which is Kiryat Arba,
                and Jewish settlements and communities are governed by a separate municipal body. The city is one of the four holy
                cities in the Jewish religion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron" target="_blank">wikipedia</a></p>
